![demo-preview1](./github-materials/demo.gif)

- support for CanvasItem nodes (Node2D, Control and any of their subtype)

- Done!


## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to check [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) section

```gdscript 
# in your Node2D script

@export var arr1: Array[Vector2]
@export var arr2: PackedVector2Array
```

- click "Edit in 2D view" button in the inspector right above your property to enter edit mode

- if there is less then 3 items in your array the button will add missing points (it won't override existing ones)

## Troubleshooting

- plugin support only CanvasItem nodes, e.g. Node2D, Control and any of their subtype. For all the other the edit btn will be blocked 
- plugin support only `Array[Vector2]` or `PackedVector2Array` types and won't work if you have like array of `Vector2` without explicit type 
- if the node was already in focus before enabling the plugin - refocus it to see the edit buttons
